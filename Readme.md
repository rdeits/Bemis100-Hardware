# Bemis-100 Hardware

A few files which have been useful in building the physical side of the Bemis100 (see <https://github.com/mboyd/Bemis-100>). 

## XLR-box
A small case for an Arduino UNO and the necessary connectors to run the GE ColorEffects lights that I use along with the Bemis100 code. Designed to be laser cut out of 3mm acrylic with 3-pin XLR connectors for data and power. More info here: <http://blog.robindeits.com/2012/04/23/my-dads-new-lights/>
